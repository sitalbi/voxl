# Voxl

Minecraft clone

## TODO
- Classes: scene/world, player, camera, mesh, chunk

-> World: contains cubes and player (so first make it contains a single cube and after we will use chunks)
-> Player: contains camera and its own logic ofc
-> Cube: contains mesh + its own logic 

- Use a namespace (voxl)
